# VBScheduler Feature Wishlist

Future feature ideas to revisit later.

---

## 1. Payment Tracking

**Problem:** Host needs to track who has chipped in for court fees.

**Display:** Both approaches:
- Checkmark next to player name in roster
- Separate "Payments" tab on organizer view

**Implementation ideas:**
- Add `has_paid` boolean to players table
- Show payment checkmark in roster list
- Add "Payments" tab with summary view (5/12 paid, $X collected)
- Toggle checkbox to mark paid/unpaid
- Optional: Deep link to Venmo with pre-filled amount

## 2. Multi-Group Support

**Problem:** App is currently built for one friend group. How do we let others use it?

**Questions to explore:**
- Public games vs private games?
- User accounts / authentication?
- Group/team concept?
- Invite-only vs open registration?
- Custom player rosters per organizer?
- Branding / white-label options?
